Content = Event - Actions for user to undertake in plain language
Selection = Asking autocal for a series of activities to undertake
- Selection Algorithm - A sequence of symbols to indicate which groups of activities to select from. Use `0` or ` ` to indicate none. Example:
- `+ -` - Do a charging act, then a none, then a draining. If no 'none's are indicated, then one will be inserted when the algorithm is repeated.
